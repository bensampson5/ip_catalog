Welcome to OpenHDL's documentation!
===================================

OpenHDL is a library of open source, parameterized digital hardware designs. While other similar libraries do exist,
OpenHDL is unique in that it takes advantage of state-of-the-art development best practices and tools from the software community including:

- `Continuous integration (CI) workflows <https://github.com/bensampson5/openhdl/actions>`_ integrated with Docker_
- `OpenHDL docker images <https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/bensampson5/openhdl>`_ published to `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/>`_
- Fast, automated unit testing using Verilator_ and Catch2_ with VCD_ outputs for waveform viewing
- Automated formatting used Verible_
- `Extensive documentation <https://openhdl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ using Sphinx_
- Useful examples that are easily built and run so you can get started with OpenHDL in minutes
